Notes for building on Ubuntu 16.04
==================================

Building
--------
Check out / unpack the source to a directory of your choice, and descend into that directory.
The package build files are stored in extra/Ubuntu16.04, so create a symbolic link to this directory:

bob@pc:~> ln -s extra/Ubuntu16.04 ./debian

Now run debuild:

bob@pc:~> debuild -uc -us -b
