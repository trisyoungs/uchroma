Notes for building on LEAP 42.1
===============================

Packaging
---------
The package spec file is stored in extra/LEAP42.1.

First, create a heirarchy of build dirs:

bob@pc:~> mkdir -p rpm/BUILD rpm/BUILDROOT rpm/RPMS rpm/SRPMS rpm/SOURCES

Copy the spec file to the rpm directory:

bob@pc:~> cp extra/LEAP42.1/uchroma.spec ./rpm

You now need to get/make a tardist of the source and place in rpm/SOURCES

bob@pc:~> make dist
bob@pc:~> mv uchroma-*.tar.gz rpm/SOURCES

Descend into the directory, and build the rpm.

bob@pc:~> cd rpm
bob@pc:~> rpmbuild --define "_topdir ${PWD}" -ba uchroma.spec

Optionally, provide a --target=i386 switch to force a specific architecture.
