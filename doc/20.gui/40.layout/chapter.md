The main view in **uChroma**, at its simplest, consists of one graph area in which many different datasets/collections can be displayed. However, it is possible to partition the view up into smaller sections in order to visualise different data separately from each other, to provide different views of the same data, or to show analysis of data displayed elsewhere. Both three-dimensional (XYZ) and two-dimensional (flat XY, XZ, and YZ) plots can be displayed.

An individual region of the main view is called a _pane_, and by default in a new session the main view has one single pane filling all the available area. This pane displays one, and only one, set of axes, and in this sense displays one single graph (but which may contain as many collections as you wish). The **Layout Window** allows new panes to be added, and existing ones resized and moved.
